abstract="The problems of finding a longest common subsequence of two sequencesA andB and a shortest edit script for transformingA intoB have long been known to be dual problems. In this paper, they are shown to be equivalent to finding a shortest/longest path in an edit graph. Using this perspective, a simpleO(ND) time and space algorithm is developed whereN is the sum of the lengths ofA andB andD is the size of the minimum edit script forA andB. The algorithm performs well when differences are small (sequences are similar) and is consequently fast in typical applications. The algorithm is shown to haveO(N+D2) expected-time performance under a basic stochastic model. A refinement of the algorithm requires onlyO(N) space, and the use of suffix trees leads to anO(N logN+D2) time variation.",

abstract="In this paper we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature.Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination:any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself,and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys,without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritativ secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model,and exceptionally efficient:adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",
